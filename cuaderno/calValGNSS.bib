	abstract = {We compare the measurement results of antenna cable delay obtained from six different techniques, including some that allow the measurement of the cable installed in-situ. Among these techniques, the reï¬‚ection of a pulse from the open end of the cable is described and compared with the results obtained with all the other techniques. We obtain a sub-ns consistency between all techniques for three cables of different types, the best technique, based on a Vector Network Analyzer, providing an uncertainty we estimate within 100 ps.},
